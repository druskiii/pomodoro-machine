Hi Friends üëãüèæ, 

Welcome to my Pomodoro TimeMachine App! I completed this project as part of my FreeCodeCamp curriculum, and I used mainly used React, HTML, CSS, a few web packages, and of course, JS to complete this project.

As many of us know, it can sometimes be hard to know how much time we spend on a project. It can be equally as hard to stay on track in a world saturated with distractions. This app will help me and others to stay focused and see our projects to completion - while also getting some much-needed rest in between sessions by practicing some active self-care! 

I learned just how important it is to make your projects easily accessible to other developers, and to yourself... when you're looking at your project 6 months later. üòâ While many other Pomodoro Apps just focus on set time limits, and three functional buttons max, my app lets the user decide how much time they want for their work time, their break, and bonus - it's all set in a relaxing and motivating background that I created with extensive css styling. 

    Features: Increase Break Time (up to 60 minutes)
              Decrease Break Time (up to 60 minutes)
              Increase Session Time (up to 60 minutes)
              Decrease Session Time (up to 60 minutes)
              Start/Stop Session Timer
              Reset Timer

Even though I made this app 6-months ago, I still use it daily in my coding sessions! I personally use the 52-minute Session/17-minute Break setup for my coding pleasure. I encourage anyone who wants to use a highly personalized focus app to try this one!


Thanks for reading x Happy coding ‚å®Ô∏è,
Dru
